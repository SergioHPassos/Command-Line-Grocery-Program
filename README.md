# Cplusplus-Program

  This project takes an input file that contains grocery items sold for a day. Then produces a list of all items purchased in each day along with the number of times each item was purchased. Secondly, it produces a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in each day. Lastly, it produces a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in each day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased. I also followed the best programming practices. Keeping code modularized. Functions are not overly engineered. A challenged I faced was validating the user input; I was able to accomplish the validation but needed to test extensively to ensure its was operational. Additionally, I can carry over the way I designed the main loop of the program. The logic would be the same besides syntax.
